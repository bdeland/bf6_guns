Not 100% scientifically accurate but has good qualities as an indicator, such as horizontal recoil being more punishing to accuracy than vertical, as well as maintaining the relationship between a weapon's recoil and damage per shot.",,,"Burst Hits - Average from 11 uncompensated bursts on a  target at 20 meters. 

Cannot score more hits than the weapon's BTK. I don't see it as a problem as it reflects the reality that excess accuracy is wasted."

It is the author's opinion that this is one of the most important metrics for automatic weapons.

Important! These Power Scores are arbitrary values, not an average TTK in milliseconds. These are not an accurate representation of the average lethality - they are more of an aid for comprehension, made up arbitrarily. A more accurate metric could be possible but would require complicated, rigorous testing and much more data."
