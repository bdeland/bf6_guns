# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ⚡ Super Simple Setup!

### Step 1: Test Locally (Optional)

Simply **double-click `index.html`** and it will open in your browser!

The data is embedded in the page, so no server is needed. You can browse and test everything locally.

### Step 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Recommended)

Make your dashboard live on the internet for free!

1. **Create a GitHub repository**
2. **Upload all files** (or push via Git)
3. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
4. **Share your link:** `https://bdeland.github.io/bf6_guns/`

📖 **See `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.**

## 📁 Required Files

Make sure these files are in the same folder:

- ✅ `index.html` - Main dashboard page

- ✅ `styles.css` - Beautiful styling
- ✅ `data.js` - Embedded weapon data
- ✅ `data.csv` - Original data file (for reference)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard not loading?

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for specific errors
3. **Ensure internet connection** (Chart.js loads from CDN)

### Charts not showing?
