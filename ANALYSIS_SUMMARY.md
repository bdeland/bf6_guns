## üîó KEY CORRELATIONS

### Strongest Correlations Found:

1. **Burst Accuracy ‚Üî Long Range Accuracy**: 0.999
   - Nearly perfect correlation - weapons accurate at close range stay accurate at long range

2. **Burst Accuracy ‚Üî CQB Accuracy**: 0.997
   - Confirms consistency across engagement ranges

3. **RPM ‚Üî Fire Interval**: -0.973
   - Perfect inverse relationship (as expected mathematically)

### Weak/Negative Correlations:
- **RPM vs TTK at different ranges**: -0.28 to -0.40
  - Higher fire rate DOES reduce TTK, but not as strongly as one might expect
  - Accuracy and damage per shot matter significantly

## üîç INTERESTING FINDINGS

### The "Accuracy Paradox"
- **TR-7** has only 0.60 burst accuracy (poor) but achieves #2 overall ranking
- **M277** has the worst accuracy (0.52) but highest practical lethality (0.542)
- **Conclusion**: High damage per shot can compensate for poor accuracy

### The "SMG Problem"
- SMGs have excellent fire rates and good accuracy
- However, they suffer from:
  - Worst projectile velocity (makes hitting moving targets harder)
  - Highest damage dropoff
  - Only viable for close range combat

### The "LMG Dominance"
- LMGs win overall despite not having the fastest TTK
- Their combination of accuracy, consistency, and all-range effectiveness makes them superior
- Trade-off: Likely lower mobility (not measured in this dataset)

### The "Velocity Matters"
- Correlation between velocity and long-range TTK: moderate
- But weapons with high velocity feel better in real combat
- **KV9** suffers despite 1080 RPM due to 348 m/s velocity
